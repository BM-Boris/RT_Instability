# **Rayleigh-Taylor Instability** 

**RT_line.py** simulates the hydrodynamic instability called *"Rayleigh-Taylor Instability"* in porous medium*. The program uses parallel programming to solve a system of differential equations with complex initial conditions for a two-dimensional configuration and determine the relationship between the modeling result and the system parameters. To visualize the instability's progress over time, the program employs Plotly for visualization.
